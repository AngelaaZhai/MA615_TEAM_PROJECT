```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r cars}
library("tidyverse")
war <- read_xlsx("usaimport.xlsx")
colnames(war)<-c("Commodity","Country","Time","Money")
liveanimalchina<-filter(.data = war, Country =="China") %>%
  filter(str_detect(Commodity , "Live Animals")) %>%
  filter(str_detect(Time, starts_with("201")))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}


 a<-group_by(.data = liveanimalchina, Time)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
